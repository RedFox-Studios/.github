## GitHub Organization Update 5

### Asset Management  

- **Integrated Image Assets**:  
  - Merged the previously separate image asset repository into the main repository.  
  - All team icons, role emojis, and other graphical assets are now consolidated for easier access and management.  
  - Organized images into clearly labeled folders for better navigation.  

- **Deprecated Asset Repository**:
